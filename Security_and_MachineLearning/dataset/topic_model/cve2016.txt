That vulnerability could allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Any exploitation of this is dependent on the user being able to cause or anticipate the failure non_zero return code of a Prolog script that their job would run on. This issue affects all Slurm versions from September to present. Workarounds to prevent exploitation of this are to either disable your Prolog script or modify it such that it always returns \success and adjust it to set the node as down using scontrol instead of relying on the slurmd to handle that automatically. If you do not have a Prolog set you are unaffected by this issue

An issue was discovered in Sprecher Automation SPRECON_E Service Program before SP0. Under certain preconditions it is possible to execute telegram simulation as a non_admin user. As prerequisites a user must have created an online_connection validly authenticated and authorized as administrator and executed telegram simulation. After that the online_connection must have been closed. Incorrect caching of client data then may lead to privilege escalation where a subsequently acting non_admin user is permitted to do telegram simulation. In order to exploit this vulnerability a potential attacker would need to have both a valid engineering_account in the SPRECON RBAC system as well as access to a service/maintenance computer with SPRECON_E Service Program running. Additionally a valid admin_user must have closed the service connection beforehand without closing the program having executed telegram simulation the attacker then has access to the running software instance. Hence there is no risk from external attackers

An issue was discovered on LG devices using the MTK chipset with L / M / and N software and RCA Voyager Tablet BLU Advance and BLU R1 HD devices. The MTKLogger app with a package name of com.mediatek.mtklogger has application components that are accessible to any application that resides on the device. Namely the com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.LogReceiver and com.mediatek.mtklogger.framework.MTKLoggerService application components are exported since they contain an intent filter are not protected by a custom permission and do not explicitly set the android exported attribute to false. Therefore these components are exported by default and are thus accessible to any third party application by using android.content.Intent object for communication. These application components can be used to start and stop the logs using Intent objects with embedded data. The available logs are the GPS log modem log network log and mobile log. The base directory that contains the directories for the types of logs is /sdcard/mtklog which makes them accessible to apps that require the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission.

An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read write and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file it sets the android sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third_party app to read write and delete files owned by the system user. The third_party app can modify the /data/system/users/0/settings_secure.xml file to add an app as a notification listener to be able to receive the text of notifications as they are received on the device. This also allows the /data/system/users/0/accounts.db to be read which contains authentication tokens for various accounts on the device. The third_party app can obtain privileged information and also modify files to obtain more privileges on the device

The content provider named com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider in the app with a package name of com.adups.fota.sysoper allows any app on the device to read write and delete files as the system user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file it sets the android sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user which is a very privileged user on the device. This allows a third_party app to read write and delete the user's sent and received text messages and call log. This allows a third_party app to obtain PII from the user without permission to do so
An issue was discovered on BLU Advance and BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The com.adups.fota.sysoper app is installed as a system app and cannot be disabled by the user. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file it sets the android sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user which is a very privileged user on the device. The app has an exported broadcast receiver named com.adups.fota.sysoper.WriteCommandReceiver which any app on the device can interact with. Therefore any app can send a command embedded in an intent which will be executed by the WriteCommandReceiver component which is executing as the system user. The third_party app utilizing the WriteCommandReceiver can perform the following actions call a phone number factory reset the device take pictures of the screen record the screen in a video install applications inject events obtain the Android log and others. In addition the com.adups.fota.sysoper.TaskService component will make a request to a URL of where the commands in the String array with a key of sf in the JSON Object sent back by the server will be executed as the system user. Since the connection is made via HTTP it is vulnerable to a MITM attack
An issue was discovered on BLU R1 HD devices with Shanghai Adups software. The two package names involved in the exfiltration are com.adups.fota and com.adups.fota.sysoper. In the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file it sets the android sharedUserId attribute to a value of android.uid.system which makes it execute as the system user which is a very privileged user on the device. Therefore the app executing as the system user has been granted a number of powerful permissions even though they are not present in the com.adups.fota.sysoper app's AndroidManifest.xml file. This app provides the com.adups.fota app access to the user's call log text messages and various device identifiers through the com.adups.fota.sysoper.provider.InfoProvider component. The com.adups.fota app uses timestamps when it runs and is eligible to exfiltrate the user's PII every hours. If hours have passed since the value of the timestamp then the exfiltration will be triggered by the user plugging in the device to charge or when they leave or enter a wireless network. The exfiltration occurs in the background without any user interaction

An issue was discovered in the IPv6 protocol specification related to ICMP Packet Too Big PTB messages. The scope of this CVE is all affected IPv6 implementations from all vendors. The security implications of IP fragmentation have been discussed at length in [RFC6274] and [RFC7739]. An attacker can leverage the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments to trigger the use of fragmentation in an arbitrary IPv6 flow in scenarios in which actual fragmentation of packets is not needed and can subsequently perform any type of fragmentation_based attack against legacy IPv6 nodes that do not implement [RFC6946]. That is employing fragmentation where not actually needed allows for fragmentation_based attack vectors to be employed unnecessarily. We note that unfortunately even nodes that already implement [RFC6946] can be subject to DoS attacks as a result of the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments. Let us assume that Host A is communicating with Host B and that as a result of the widespread dropping of IPv6 packets that contain extension headers including fragmentation [RFC7872] some intermediate node filters fragments between Host B and Host A. If an attacker sends a forged ICMPv6 PTB error message to Host B reporting an MTU smaller than this will trigger the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments from that moment on as required by [RFC2460] When Host B starts sending IPv6 atomic fragments in response to the received ICMPv6 PTB error message these packets will be dropped since we previously noted that IPv6 packets with extension headers were being dropped between Host B and Host A. Thus this situation will result in a DoS scenario. Another possible scenario is that in which two BGP peers are employing IPv6 transport and they implement Access Control Lists ACLs to drop IPv6 fragments to avoid control_plane attacks If the aforementioned BGP peers drop IPv6 fragments but still honor received ICMPv6 PTB error messages an attacker

An off_path attacker can cause a preemptible client association to be demobilized in NTP p4 and earlier and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 by sending a crypto NAK packet to a victim client with a spoofed source address of an existing associated peer. This is true even if authentication is enabled
An attacker can spoof a packet from a legitimate ntpd server with an origin timestamp that matches the peer_>dst timestamp recorded for that server. After making this switch the client in NTP p4 and earlier and NTPSec aa48d001683e5b791a743ec9c575aaf7d867a2b0c will reject all future legitimate server responses. It is possible to force the victim client to move time after the mode has been changed. ntpq gives no indication that the mode has been switched
A malicious authenticated peer can create arbitrarily_many ephemeral associations in order to win the clock selection algorithm in ntpd in NTP p4 and earlier and NTPsec 3e160db8dc248a0bcb053b56a80167dc742d2b74 and a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 and modify a victim's clock
An exploitable vulnerability exists in the message authentication functionality of libntp in ntp p4 and NTPSec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92. An attacker can send a series of crafted messages to attempt to recover the message digest key
ntpd in NTP p3 and NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92 relies on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that impersonate reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock for example that reaches the receive function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker

An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange OX AppSuite before _rev27. The aria_label parameter of tiles at the Portal can be used to inject script code. Those labels use the name of the file e.g. an image which gets displayed at the portal application. Using script code at the file name leads to script execution. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session_hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface sending mail deleting data etc. Users actively need to add a file to the portal to enable this attack. In case of shared files however a internal attacker may modify a previously embedded file to carry a malicious file name. Furthermore this vulnerability can be used to persistently execute code that got injected by a temporary script execution vulnerability

An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange OX App Suite before _rev11. The content sanitizer component has an issue with filtering malicious content in case invalid HTML code is provided. In such cases the filter will output a unsanitized representation of the content. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session_hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface sending mail deleting data etc. Attackers can use this issue for filter evasion to inject script code later on
An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange OX App Suite before _rev10. App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was performed using a non_interactive login method. In case the setting was enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the interactive login page the workflow was correct. Cookies with authentication information may become available to other users on shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the session third parties with access to the same client can access a user's account
An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange OX Guard before _rev8. OX Guard uses an authentication token to identify and transfer guest users' credentials. The OX Guard API acts as a padding oracle by responding with different error codes depending on whether the provided token matches the encryption padding. In combination with AES_CBC this allows attackers to guess the correct padding. Attackers may run brute_forcing attacks on the content of the guest authentication token and discover user credentials. For a practical attack vector the guest users needs to have logged in the content of the guest user's \OxReaderID cookie and the value of the auth parameter needs to be known to the attacker

A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in BlueStacks App Player. The BlueStacks App Player installer creates a registry key with weak permissions that allows users to execute arbitrary programs with SYSTEM privileges
When opening a Hangul HShow Document .hpt and processing a structure within the document Hancom Office will attempt to allocate space for a block of data within the file. When calculating this length the application will use a value from the file and add a constant to it without checking whether the addition of the constant will cause the integer to overflow which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into it. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code_execution under the context of the application
When opening a Hangul HShow Document .hpt and processing a structure within the document Hancom Office will use a field from the structure in an operation that can cause the integer to overflow. This result is then used to allocate memory to copy file data in. Due to the lack of bounds checking on the integer the allocated memory buffer can be made to be undersized at which point the reading of file data will write outside the bounds of the buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application
When opening a Hangul HShow Document .hpt and processing a structure within the document Hancom Office will use a static size to allocate a heap buffer yet explicitly trust a size from the file when modifying data inside of it. Due to this an aggressor can corrupt memory outside the bounds of this buffer which can lead to code execution under the context of the application
Multiple heap_based Buffer_overflows in the CBookBase SetDefTableStyle and CBookBase SetDefPivotStyle functions in Hancom Office VP allow remote Code_Execution via a crafted Hangul Hcell Document .cell file
When opening a Hangul Hcell Document .cell and processing a property record within the Workbook stream Hancom Office will attempt to allocate space for an element using a length from the file. When copying user_supplied data to this buffer however the application will use a different size which leads to a heap_based Buffer_overflow. This vulnerability can lead to code_execution under the context of the application
When opening a Hangul Hcell Document .cell and processing a particular record within the Workbook stream an index miscalculation leading to a heap overlow can be made to occur in Hancom Office 2014. The vulnerability occurs when processing data for a formula used to render a chart via the HncChartPlugin.hplg library. Due to a lack of bounds_checking when incrementing an index that is used for writing into a buffer for formulae the application can be made to write pointer data outside its bounds which can lead to code execution under the context of the application
When opening a Hangul Hcell Document .cell and processing a record that uses the CSSValFormat object Hancom Office will search for an underscore \_ character at the end of the string and write a null terminator after it. If the character is at the very end of the string the application will mistakenly write the null_byte outside the bounds of its destination. This can result in heap corruption that can lead code execution under the context of the application
When opening a Hangul HShow Document .hpt and processing a structure within the document Hancom Office will attempt to allocate space for a list of elements using a length from the file. When calculating this length an Integer_overflow can be made to occur which will cause the buffer to be undersized when the application tries to copy file data into the object containing this structure. This allows one to overwrite contiguous data in the heap which can lead to code_execution under the context of the application

An issue was discovered in Open_Xchange OX App Suite before _rev14. Adding images from external sources to HTML editors by drag&drop can potentially lead to script code execution in the context of the active user. To exploit this a user needs to be tricked to use an image from a specially crafted website and add it to HTML editor areas of OX App Suite for example E_Mail Compose or OX Text. This specific attack circumvents typical XSS filters and detection mechanisms since the code is not loaded from an external service but injected locally. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session_hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface sending mail deleting data etc. To exploit this vulnerability a attacker needs to convince a user to follow specific steps social_engineering

Characters from languages are such as Arabic Hebrew are displayed from RTL Right To Left order in Opera for Android due to mishandling of several unicode characters such as U+FE70 U+0622 U+0623 etc and how they are rendered combined with first strong character such as an IP address or alphabet could lead to a spoofed URL. It was noticed that by placing neutral characters such as \/ ? in filepath causes the URL to be flipped and displayed from Right To Left. However in order for the URL to be spoofed the URL must begin with an IP address followed by neutral characters as omnibox considers IP address to be combination of punctuation and numbers and since LTR Left To Right direction is not properly enforced this causes the entire URL to be treated and rendered from RTL Right To Left However it doesn't have be an IP address what matters is that first strong character generally alphabetic character in the URL must be an RTL character

The non_existent notification listener vulnerability was introduced in the initial Android builds for the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge devices but the vulnerability can persist on the device even after the device has been upgraded to an Android or build. The vulnerable system app gives a non_existent app the ability to read the notifications from the device which a third_party app can utilize if it uses a package name of com.samsung.android.app.portalservicewidget. This vulnerability allows an unprivileged third_party app to obtain the text of the user's notifications which tend to contain personal data

crypto/x509/x509_vfy.c in OpenSSL i allows remote attackers to cause a denial_of_service NULL pointer dereference and application crash by triggering a CRL operation
In OpenSSL before c applications parsing invalid CMS structures can crash with a NULL pointer dereference. This is caused by a bug in the handling of the ASN CHOICE type in OpenSSL which can result in a NULL value being passed to the structure callback if an attempt is made to free certain invalid encodings. Only CHOICE structures using a callback which do not handle NULL value are affected
In OpenSSL before c TLS connections using *_CHACHA20_POLY1305 ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS
There is a carry propagating bug in the Broadwell_specific Montgomery multiplication procedure in OpenSSL and before c that handles input lengths divisible by but longer than bits. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA DSA and DH private keys are impossible. This is because the subroutine in question is not used in operations with the private key itself and an input of the attacker's direct choice. Otherwise the bug can manifest itself as transient authentication and key negotiation failures or reproducible erroneous outcome of public_key operations with specially crafted input. Among EC algorithms only Brainpool P_512 curves are affected and one presumably can attack ECDH key negotiation. Impact was not analyzed in detail because pre_requisites for attack are considered unlikely. Namely multiple clients have to choose the curve in question and the server has to share the private key among them neither of which is default behaviour. Even then only clients that chose the curve will be affected

Nextcloud Server before and & ownCloud Server before and suffer from SMB User Authentication Bypass. Nextcloud/ownCloud include an optional and not by default enabled SMB authentication component that allows authenticating users against an SMB server. This backend is implemented in a way that tries to connect to a SMB server and if that succeeded consider the user logged_in. The backend did not properly take into account SMB servers that have any kind of anonymous auth configured. This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. Note The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud/ownCloud config file. If you have not configured the SMB backend then you're not affected by this vulnerability
Nextcloud Server before and suffers from an improper authorization check on removing shares. The Sharing Backend as implemented in Nextcloud does differentiate between shares to users and groups.

Revive Adserver before and suffers from Special_Element_Injection. Usernames weren't properly sanitised when creating users on a Revive Adserver instance. Especially control characters were not filtered allowing apparently identical usernames to co_exist in the system due to the fact that such characters are normally ignored when an HTML page is displayed in a browser. The issue could have therefore been exploited for user spoofing although elevated privileges are required to create users within Revive Adserver
Revive Adserver before and suffers from Reflected XSS. The Revive Adserver web installer scripts were vulnerable to a reflected XSS attack via the dbHost dbUser and possibly other parameters. It has to be noted that the window for such attack vectors to be possible is extremely narrow and it is very unlikely that such an attack could be actually effective

The Sophos Web Appliance version is vulnerable to two Remote Command_Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php /controllers/MgrReport.php component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses from accessing the device. The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device. The code erroneously suggests that the information handled is protected by utilizing the variable name 'escapedips' _ however this was not the case. The Sophos ID is NSWA_1258
The Sophos Web Appliance Remote / Secure Web Gateway server version is vulnerable to a Remote Command_Injection vulnerability in its web administrative interface.

An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Framework before before and before Paths provided to the ResourceServlet were not properly sanitized and as a result exposed to Directory_traversal attacks
An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Security before before and before Spring Security does not consider URL path parameters when processing security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded \/ to a request an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo as part of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat all current versions are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters from the value returned by getContextPath getServletPath and getPathInfo Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users of IBM WebSphere Application Server are known to be affected. Users of other containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected

An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source and before and before If an SDP offer or answer is received with the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes. This occurs as the code does not properly handle spaces separating the parameters. This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated. If guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or answer is still processed and the crash occurs
An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source before before and before and Certified Asterisk before _cert16 and before _cert4. The chan_sip channel driver has a liberal definition for whitespace when attempting to strip the content between a SIP header name and a colon character. Rather than following RFC and stripping only spaces and horizontal tabs Asterisk treats any non_printable ASCII character as if it were whitespace. This means that headers such as Contact x01 will be seen as a valid Contact header. This mostly does not pose a problem until Asterisk is placed in tandem with an authenticating SIP proxy. In such a case a crafty combination of valid and invalid To headers can cause a proxy to allow an INVITE request into Asterisk without authentication since it believes the request is an in_dialog request. However because of the bug described above the request will look like an out_of_dialog request to Asterisk. Asterisk will then process the request as a new call. The result is that Asterisk can process calls from unvetted sources without any authentication. If you do not use a proxy for authentication then this issue does not affect you. If your proxy is dialog_aware meaning that the proxy keeps track of what dialogs are currently valid then this issue does not affect you. If you use chan_pjsip instead of chan_sip then this issue does not affect you
